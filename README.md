## Conclusion of Analysis:

Contract Type Influence on Retention

Customers on two-year contracts have higher retention rates, with most staying loyal longer. In contrast, month-to-month contracts are a key churn driver, especially among newer customers. Transitioning month-to-month customers to annual contracts could improve retention.

At-Risk Customer Segment

Approximately 7,043 customers are at high risk of churning, with a current churn rate of 27%. This segment represents a significant $16.06 million in annual revenue and $456,120 in monthly revenue at risk. Targeted retention efforts, such as promotional offers or personalized outreach, are recommended for these customers.

Service Subscriptions and Churn

A high proportion of churned customers lack Online Security, Tech Support, and Phone Services. These services correlate with higher retention, suggesting that bundling or cross-selling these services could enhance customer satisfaction and reduce churn.

Technica  Issues with Fiber Optic

Up to 42% of churned customers were subscribed to Fiber Optic  internet services. This indicates service reliability issues, which, if resolved, could improve retention.

Support Ticket Analysis
The 2,955 technical tickets and 3,632 administrative tickets indicate a need for service efficiency improvements. Addressing common technical issues proactively could improve customer experience and reduce churn.

## Recommendations:

Focus on converting month-to-month customers to longer contracts.
Prioritize retention offers for at-risk customers, particularly those without online Security or Tech Support.
Investigate and address Fiber Optic service issues to prevent further customer losses.
